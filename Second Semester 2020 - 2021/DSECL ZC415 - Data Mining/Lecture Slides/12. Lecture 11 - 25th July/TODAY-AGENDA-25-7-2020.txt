+VE POINT/STORY - SHOES + USA-VIETNAM WAR...
1. CLUSTER ANALYSIS
2. INTRA + INTER CLUSTER SIMILARITY
3. DISTANCE CALCULATION OF DIFFERENT DATA TYPES

5. K-MEDOID CLUSTERING ALGORITHM AND EXAMPLES 
6. AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING - DENDOGRAM - SIMPLE LINK (MIN), COMPLETE LINK(MAX) AND AVERAGE LINK - EXAMPLES
======================================================================================
1.  DATA MINING - MACHINE LEARNING - MINDMAP - STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES - MINDMAP
2.  COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES
3.  CLUSTER QUALITY EVALUATION - SILHOUTEE COEFFICIENT
    uses cohesion (tightness of the points within the cluster - intra cluster) and separation (other clusters .. intra )

4. ADDITIONAL HIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING .RECAPS.. MST.ONE EXAMPLE
    BIRCH ALGORITHM - some problems

5. DENSITY BASED CLUSTERING ALGORITHS
